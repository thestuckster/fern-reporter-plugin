# Fern JUnit Publisher

A Gradle plugin for publishing JUnit test results to a Fern test reporting instance.

## Overview

This plugin simplifies the process of collecting JUnit XML test reports and publishing them to a Fern test reporting service. It parses JUnit XML reports, converts them to Fern's data model, and sends them to your Fern instance through its API.

To learn more about Fern, check out [it's repository](https://github.com/guidewire-oss/fern-reporter)

## Features

- Parse JUnit XML test reports in various formats
- Group test suites and test cases into a cohesive test run
- Track test execution time and status
- Support for test tags
- Configurable verbosity for debugging

## Installation

Add the plugin to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.guidewire.fern-publisher") version "1.0.0"
}
```

Or in `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'com.guidewire.fern-publisher' version '1.0.0'
}
```

## Configuration

Configure the plugin in your build script:

```kotlin
fernPublisher {
    fernUrl.set("https://your-fern-instance.example.com")
    projectName.set("my-project")
    reportPaths.set(listOf("build/test-results/**/*.xml"))
    fernTags.set(listOf("automated", "integration"))
    verbose.set(false)
}
```

### Parameters

| Property | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| fernUrl | URL of your Fern instance | Yes | - |
| projectName | Name of your project in Fern | Yes | - |
| reportPaths | Glob patterns for locating JUnit XML reports | Yes | - |
| fernTags | Tags to apply to all tests | No | empty list |
| verbose | Enable verbose logging | No | false |

## Usage

Run the task to publish test results:

```
./gradlew publishToFern
```

You can also make it run automatically after your tests:

```kotlin
tasks.named("test") {
    finalizedBy("publishToFern")
}
```

## Examples

```kotlin
fernPublisher {
    fernUrl.set("https://fern.example.com")
    projectName.set("backend-api")
    reportPaths.set(listOf("build/test-results/**/*.xml"))
}
```

### Multiple Report Sources

```kotlin
fernPublisher {
    fernUrl.set("https://fern.example.com")
    projectName.set("full-stack")
    reportPaths.set(listOf(
        "${project.buildDir}/test-results/test/**/*.xml",
        "frontend/build/test-results/*.xml"
    ))
    fernTags.set(listOf("ci", "nightly"))
}
```

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/fern-junit-publisher.git
cd fern-junit-publisher
./gradlew build
```

## Development 

You can build and publish this plugin for use locally with the command 
```bash
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

You should see the plugin in your local `.m2` repository. 

From there you can set up a test project to use the plugin. Make sure to edit your `settings.gradle` file to use plugins
found in your local m2 repository.

```gradle
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        mavenLocal()
    }
}
```
